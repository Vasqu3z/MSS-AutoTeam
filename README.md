Run main.py, and follow the instructions on the window.


This application allows users to add Mario Super Sluggers teams to the register, then automatically input those teams into the game.

By default, the automation stops after entering the teams and rules (before the game starts). Enable the "Auto-start game" checkbox near the Run it! button to have it press start automatically once team entry is complete. The default for this toggle is off to avoid starting the game until you confirm everything looks right.
